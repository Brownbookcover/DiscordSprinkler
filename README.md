# Sprinkler-Bot
A Discord bot that uses a Raspberry Pi and Discord.py to be able to schedule and run a sprinkler system over the internet

NOTE: My code for privacy reasons at an not included file to find the Discord bot token so I can keep it private. If you want to use my code as is, in the same directory where you put index.py also include token.txt file with your Discord bot token. Alternativly, delete my code near the start of each file that sets the botToken using a file and at the bottom instead add your own Discord token on the last line.
