# Sprinkler-Bot
A Discord bot that uses a Raspberry Pi and Discord.py to be able to schedule and run a sprinkler system over the internet

NOTE: My code for privacy reasons looks a directory above to find the Discord bot token so I can keep it private. If you want to use my code as is, in the directory above wherever you put the code make a token.txt file. Alternativly, delete my code near the start of each file that sets the botToken using a file and at the bottom instead add your own Discord token on the last line.
